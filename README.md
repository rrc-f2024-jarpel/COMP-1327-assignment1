## Assignment
    Answer questions about git commands and utilize them to make a repository

# First git status output:
On branch main

No commits yet

nothing to commit (create/copy files and use "git add" to track)

# Second git status output:
On branch main

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        README.md

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

# Purpose of following commands:
- 'mkdir':
    Makes a directory/folder
- 'cd':
    changes directory to the one specified after eg: cd "My Documents"
- 'code':
    Opens the visual editor. In this case Visual Studio Code
- 'ls':
    lists directories in the current directory

# Why Version Control is important
## with version control, it is possible to:
- Easily manage a project with multiple members
-Allow multiple people to work on the same project without worrying about conflicting code
-Allows you to make test versions while still having a functioning version up for use
-If a major error should occur you can see what version this error popped up and if neccesary you can roll back to a previous version

# Purpose of the following Git Commands
- 'git init':
    Initializes GIT in the current directory, turning it into a repository so it can interact with websites like github

- 'git status':
    Displays the status of the files in the repository. Whether they are being tracked, and if the local repository is up to date

- 'git add':
    Adds untracked files to the repository

- 'git commit':
    Adds tracked files to a commit, this allows to to push them in a bunch to the current branch, along with a message

- 'git push':
    pushes whatever has been commited to the current branch so others can access these changes

- 'git pull':
    pulls from the main repository to update the local repository of anychanges

- 'git log':
    dispalys a history of all the commits for the current repository

- 'git branch':
    Used to create new branches, list the branches availible in the repository, or delete branches

- 'git merge':
    Merges two branches together, this may cause conflicts and these will need to be resolved. Often a git pull aleviates many merge conflicts

- 'git checkout':
    Changes the current branch to the one specified

# My Unique Touch
## What sets me apart from others:
- I enjoy long bike rides
- I am tall, standing at 6'4" so i am quite noticable in a crowd
- I also enjoy long walks and hiking
- Play the Hurdy Gurdy, which is a very niche instrument best descibed as a cross between a violin and bagpipes
