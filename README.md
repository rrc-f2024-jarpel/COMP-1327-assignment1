# Why Version Control is important
## with version control, it is possible to:
- Easily manage a project with multiple members
-Allow multiple people to work on the same project without worrying about conflicting code
-Allows you to make test versions while still having a functioning version up for use
-If a major error should occur you can see what version this error popped up and if neccesary you can roll back to a previous version
